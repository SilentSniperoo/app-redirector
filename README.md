# app-redirector

A more sophisticated C++ shortcut for a select few Windows apps.

Minecraft isn't portable, in that you can't put it on a USB and run from there.

Google Keep, Google Hangouts, and Chrome Remote Desktop used to install with the same icon as Chrome, making the shortcuts not recognizable in the Windows Start Menu (although this is no longer the case).

This app makes Minecraft portable and the others have recognizable icons.

Check out the "MinecraftPortable" directory to see the resulting drag-and-drop no-installation-necessary Minecraft in all its glory.
